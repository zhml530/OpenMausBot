// The sidecar is a separate process on purpose — it is the only thing here
// that listens off-machine, and keeping it out of the harness is what lets
// the harness stay loopback-only and unpatched. But "separate process" does
// not have to mean "open a terminal": the app already forks the harness the
// same way, and a toggle in Settings is what anyone actually wants.
//
// The renderer never talks to the sidecar's control port directly. It calls
// through here, which keeps the UI on one origin, avoids CORS, and means the
// narrow list of things the renderer may ask for is written down in one
// place rather than implied by whatever the control server happens to serve.
