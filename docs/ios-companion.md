# iOS companion architecture

The iOS app is a thin, native client for the Roundtable instance running on
your Mac. The Mac remains the only machine that owns agent processes,
credentials, SQLite data, transcripts, and computers. The phone discovers or
is told how to reach the Mac, pairs once, and then uses the same HTTP and SSE
contract as the desktop client through a restricted sidecar.

## Current status

The first version includes:

- Bonjour discovery on the same LAN and manual address entry.
- Remote access through a Tailscale MagicDNS name or an optional
  account-provisioned HTTPS address.
- QR-first pairing with a short-lived, single-use credential and a six-digit
  manual fallback, plus per-device tokens, device listing, and revocation.
- Bot and room lists, paged transcripts, sending, interruption, and unread
  state.
- Approvals and questions, including narrow “always allow” grants.
- Resumable SSE, streamed reply text, reconnect hydration, and an opt-in live
  Box computer view. The loopback-only VPS SSH viewer remains desktop-only.
- Markdown rendering and Keychain storage for the device token.

It is foreground-only. Push notifications, closed-app background delivery,
voice, and App Store release automation are not part of this version. The
optional hosted transport connects to the user's own computer; it is not a
cloud transcript store and cannot wake a terminated iOS app.

The Mac must be running Roundtable and must not be asleep. Companion Settings
offers an off-by-default **Keep this computer awake** switch that prevents
system sleep while Companion is on; the display may still turn off. A sleeping
or powered-off computer cannot receive phone requests or run its local
routines, including through the optional hosted transport.

There are three deliberately separate trust surfaces:

| Surface | Bind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Harness | `127.0.0.1:8799` | Existing app API; remains loopback-only |
| Companion | `0.0.0.0:8810` | Paired native devices; authenticated and allowlisted |
| Companion control | `127.0.0.1:8811` | Start pairing, cancel pairing, list devices, revoke |
| Hosted gateway | `127.0.0.1:8812` | Guardian-owned route to one exact sidecar generation |

The desktop app owns the sidecar lifecycle through
`electron/companion.mjs`. The renderer only receives narrow IPC operations; it
does not fetch the control port directly.

## SQLite compatibility

SQLite does not move onto the phone. It is an implementation detail behind the
harness API:

- `server/message-db.ts` and `server/store.ts` persist and page transcripts.
- The phone asks for `GET /api/bots?messages=50` and
  `GET /api/threads/:threadId/messages?before=…&limit=50`.
- SQLite ordering and cursors are therefore tested at the server boundary,
  while the Swift package tests decoding and prepend/deduplication using
  responses captured through the real sidecar.
- A storage migration may change the bytes on disk without changing the app.
  If an API payload changes, regenerate the fixtures with
  `node scripts/capture-companion-fixtures.mjs` and review the diff.

The sidecar keeps its device registry in `~/.Roundtable/devices.json`. That is
security state owned by the network boundary, not transcript data, so it does
not belong in the message database.

## Connectivity

### Same Wi-Fi

The sidecar advertises `_Roundtable._tcp` over Bonjour. The app browses with
`NWBrowser`, resolves the chosen service, and connects directly. If multicast
is unavailable, the desktop shows the LAN address for manual entry.

LAN traffic is plain HTTP. Use it only on a network you trust. Device tokens
are bearer credentials, so someone able to observe that LAN traffic could copy
one until the device is revoked.

Choosing a LAN or Bonjour address is therefore explicit. Once the app is using
a hosted or Tailscale route, automatic reconnection stays within those
protected transports and never sends a pairing credential or device bearer to
an old private address on the current Wi-Fi. Moving back to cleartext LAN
requires choosing that computer/address again.

### Tailscale

Tailscale is the recommended route away from home and on Wi-Fi networks that
isolate clients. Both devices join the same tailnet and the phone uses the
Mac’s MagicDNS name, such as `macbook.example.ts.net:8810`.

The URL is still `http`, but the path is encrypted and authenticated by
WireGuard inside the tailnet. Use the MagicDNS name rather than the
`100.64.0.0/10` address: App Transport Security exceptions are domain-based,
and `ios/project.yml` narrowly allows insecure HTTP for `ts.net` subdomains.
Bonjour does not cross the tailnet, so remote pairing uses manual address
entry.

Tailscale is optional. The direct path does not use an Roundtable-operated
relay or create a cloud copy of local transcript data.

### Optional hosted HTTPS

In desktop **Settings → Companion**, **Use your phone anywhere** accepts a
passwordless email code and provisions one opaque HTTPS address for that
computer. The desktop runs a pinned `cloudflared` connector outbound to
Cloudflare; no inbound router configuration or Tailscale installation is
required. The sidecar advertises the hosted address in pairing invitations only
after the route has passed an end-to-end health check. LAN, Bonjour, manual
addresses, and Tailscale continue to work without signing in.

Cloudflare terminates and proxies the encrypted connection to the connector.
The Roundtable control plane stores account and installation metadata plus
opaque tunnel/DNS identifiers in D1, but not bots, transcripts, approvals,
screen frames, pairing tokens, or connector tokens. See `docs/ios-privacy.md`
for data and deletion details.

The connector does not point at the reusable LAN port. Electron launches one
private sidecar socket (or Windows pipe) and a guardian that owns both the
fixed loopback gateway and `cloudflared`. If Electron or that sidecar exits,
the guardian first makes forwarding unavailable, confirms the connector is
dead, and only then releases the gateway. Another process that later binds a
local port cannot inherit the public route.

## Pairing and device security

1. The user enables Companion in desktop Settings and starts pairing.
2. The desktop opens a two-minute pairing window. Its QR contains the reachable
   address and a high-entropy, single-use credential; the visible six-digit code
   remains available for manual entry and older app builds.
3. The phone scans and validates the invitation, shows the computer and address,
   and asks the user to confirm before it connects. Scanning never auto-pairs.
4. The phone sends the one-time credential and a device name to `POST /api/pair`.
   Redeeming either the QR credential or manual code closes the entire window,
   so neither can be replayed.
5. The sidecar returns a separate random device token once and stores only its
   SHA-256 digest.
6. The phone stores the device token in Keychain and sends it as a bearer token.
   It never persists the QR credential or manual code.
7. Revoking the device on the Mac invalidates future requests and sends the
   phone back to pairing.

After pairing, the phone periodically reads the authenticated, sidecar-owned
`GET /api/companion/endpoints` snapshot. This lets an existing phone learn a
new hosted address—or its withdrawal—without another pairing ceremony. The
route never reaches the harness and returns only the computer name plus a
bounded list of connection origins.

This mirrors the direct-pairing security shape used by T3 Code: a high-entropy
bootstrap credential, explicit confirmation of the scanned target, and a
one-time exchange for a securely stored long-lived credential. An Roundtable
account is not required for LAN or Tailscale. The optional hosted route requires
the desktop owner to authenticate before provisioning, while the phone still
uses the same per-computer pairing credential.

The device-facing socket rejects browser `Origin` headers before reading a
token. Its route policy in `companion/src/routes.ts` is default-deny: a new
harness route remains unreachable until it is deliberately added.

Allowed in the first release:

- Read the fleet, rooms, instances, configuration status, and transcripts.
- Fetch settled screen images and opt into live screen frames.
- Request a fresh interactive cloud-desktop viewer only when the computer
  owner has enabled that capability for this specific paired phone.
- Send messages, interrupt bots, answer approvals/questions, and mark chats
  read.
- Create a basic bot.

The write surface uses purpose-built `read` and `always-allow` endpoints. The
general bot and room `PATCH` endpoints are not reachable through the sidecar.
An always-allow request succeeds only when its server-issued key is still on a
pending approval for that bot, so possession of a device token is not enough
to invent a broad execution grant.

Intentionally refused:

- API keys and provider configuration.
- Pairing, device revocation, or companion lifecycle control.
- Local VM lifecycle, webhooks, connectors, routines, team import/export, and
  internal peer-agent routes.
- Cloud computer provisioning, sleep, shell execution, and screenshot APIs.
  The phone receives only the fresh `join` viewer URL, never the provider key.
- New harness routes that have not been reviewed for phone access.

## Stream and state model

`CompanionCore` contains the wire models, client, raw-byte SSE parser, and pure
state fold. The SwiftUI target owns lifecycle and presentation only.

On connection, the server sends a `hello` frame containing a cursor and whether
the requested gap was replayed. The client:

1. resumes from its last `<streamId>:<seq>` cursor;
2. folds replayed and live frames when the gap is available;
3. hydrates the newest page of each visible conversation when it is not; and
4. paginates older transcript pages on demand.

Unknown message and frame kinds degrade safely instead of failing an entire
response, and one malformed fleet record does not hide every healthy chat.
Screen frames are off by default and enabled only while a computer view is
visible. Backgrounding deliberately closes the stream; foregrounding
reconnects from the saved cursor. A hello cursor is committed only after a
cold hydration succeeds; replayed streams advance it one folded frame at a
time, so a disconnect during recovery cannot skip the remaining gap.

## Verification contract

The merge gate for this feature is:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build:companion
pnpm check:electron

cd ios
swift test
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project OpenMausCompanion.xcodeproj \
  -scheme OpenMausCompanion \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

The simulator validates compilation, launch, layout, manual address parsing,
and failure states. Bonjour, Local Network permission, Tailscale routing,
Keychain behavior across a reboot, and approval delivery still require a real
iPhone pass.

## Follow-on releases

Keep the foundational merge separate from capabilities that widen security or
distribution scope:

1. **Foundation:** sidecar, desktop controls, Swift core/app, pairing, chat,
   approvals, reconnect, simulator and contract CI.
2. **Desktop conversation parity:** task create/switch/rename/delete, SQLite
   search with exact-message landing, transcript export/share, reactions, and
   edit/version controls. Archived or hidden chat management remains desktop-only.
3. **Notifications:** native permission, live/replayed alerts, time-sensitive
   approvals, badges, and background reconciliation are in the app. Closed-app
   delivery still requires project-owned APNs credentials and a hosted relay;
   Tailscale cannot wake a terminated iOS process.
4. **Distribution:** signing, bundle ownership, privacy declarations,
   TestFlight, and App Store review material. Swift tests and an unsigned
   simulator build already run in the repository CI.
5. **Optional expansion:** voice/call mode or Local VM/host-computer
   interaction. Each requires its own threat-model review.
