// sprayed onto whatever LAN happens to use the same private address later.

// to other protected routes, while a user-selected cleartext route can be
// tried exactly once and can only move to a stronger transport. Both halves
// are pure — no sockets, no clocks — so the rules can be tested without a
// network; `Session` owns when they run.
