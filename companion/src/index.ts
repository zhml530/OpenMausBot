//   :8811  127.0.0.1  you         pairing and revocation — never off-machine

//   UDS/pipe            one Electron-owned sidecar generation, never TCP
//
// 8810 rather than 8800, which is where these started: the harness opens a

// app this is a sidecar to. Ten clear of the harness leaves it room to add
// another adjacent listener without taking this one out again.
//
// Running this process *is* the opt-in. There is no toggle, because a toggle
// inside a process you chose to start would be ceremony: stopping it is the
// off switch, and it is a more honest one than a flag in a file.
