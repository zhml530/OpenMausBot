// What happens to the sidecar when the harness dies underneath it.
//
// Not covered by proxy.test.ts, which boots a healthy harness and keeps it
// that way: the interesting case is the one where the harness goes away
// *after* the response to the phone has already been opened. There is no way
// to answer 502 at that point — the status line is long gone — and trying to
// is not merely futile, it throws ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT out of an error
// handler where nothing is waiting to catch it. One phone whose stream broke
// then takes down every other paired device with it.
//
// A fake harness rather than the real one, because the failure has to happen
// on demand and at a chosen moment.
