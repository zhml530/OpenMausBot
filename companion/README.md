# companion

The sidecar a phone talks to.

Roundtable's harness listens on `127.0.0.1` and nothing else, which is the
right default and one it has recently gone out of its way to enforce: it now
rejects any request whose `Host` is not loopback, defeating DNS rebinding.

This is a separate process that sits in front of it. A paired device reaches
*this*, over the LAN or a tailnet; this reaches the harness over loopback, as
a request from the machine the harness already trusts. The harness keeps its
loopback-only bind and gains only the paged/read/approval verbs the native
client needs; pairing, device tokens, network exposure, and response scrubbing
remain entirely in the sidecar.

That is the entire point of the design. The alternative — teaching the harness
to bind a second socket — means a patch to somebody else's request handler,
carried across every release, and it is the patch that broke the first time
upstream hardened its loopback gate.

```text
  phone ──LAN/tailnet──▶ companion :8810 ──loopback──▶ harness :8799
                          ▲                             ▲
                          │ token, allowlist,           │ unmodified,
                          │ Origin refused              │ loopback-only
```

## What it is responsible for

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pairing** | A high-entropy QR credential plus a six-digit manual fallback, valid two minutes and single-use. Redeeming either returns a device token stored only as a SHA-256 digest. |
| **Authorisation** | Every request needs that token. Full cloud-desktop access is a separate per-device capability, off by default. A rebinding page cannot obtain either. |
| **The allowlist** | Default deny, per method and path (`src/routes.ts`) — the list is every request the app makes, and nothing else. General bot/room PATCH routes stay closed; read state and approval grants use narrow verbs. A route that appears in the harness later is closed to devices until someone adds it here on purpose. |
| **Scrubbing** | `resumeCursors` — the harness's own provider session ids — never reach a device, whether or not the harness still sends them. |
| **Discovery** | Bonjour, so a phone finds the computer by name instead of by typed address. |

## Transport security

The device port speaks plain HTTP, and the device token travels in a header on
every request. Where that is safe depends on how the phone reaches the
computer, and the two routes are not equivalent:

- **Over a tailnet** — the recommended route, and the only one that works away
  from home — every packet is inside WireGuard before it touches a network, so
  the connection is encrypted and authenticated end to end despite the `http`
  in the URL.
- **Over a LAN** it is cleartext on that network. Trust it as far as you trust
  everyone on the wifi: fine at home, not fine on a café or conference network.
  Pair over the tailnet there instead.

Turning on TLS is not a drop-in improvement. A certificate for a LAN address
is one nothing can validate, so it would have to be pinned at pairing and
re-pinned whenever the sidecar regenerated it — real machinery, whose benefit
on the tailnet path is zero. Pinned TLS is what this would need before it could
claim to protect the LAN path; until then the LAN path is documented as
trusted-network-only rather than described as something it is not.

## What it deliberately does not do

- **Serve the desktop UI.** A phone asking for `/` gets a 404. Serving HTML
  here would make this a web server, which it is not.
- **Accept anything with an `Origin` header.** A native app sends none, so a
  request that carries one is a browser that has found this port. Refused
  before the token is even looked at — stricter than the harness's own rule,
  which allows loopback origins.
- **Hold credentials, settings, or Local VM control.** Those stay on the
  machine. See `src/routes.ts` for the exact refusals and why.

## Running it

With the harness already up (`pnpm dev:server`), from the repo root:

```sh
pnpm companion
```

It prints where to point the phone, and where you pair:

```text
companion  http://0.0.0.0:8810  →  harness 127.0.0.1:8799
pair here  http://127.0.0.1:8811
on your phone, enter  macbook.tail1234.ts.net:8810
```

Open the pairing page, click **Start pairing**, and type the six digits into
the phone. The normal desktop panel also turns that short-lived code and the
dialable address into a QR handoff, so the mobile app can fill both in without
putting the long-lived device token in the QR. Stopping the process is the off
switch — running it *is* the opt-in, so there is no toggle to forget.

That is the standalone way to run it, and it is what to reach for when the
harness is running on its own — a headless box, or `pnpm dev:server` in a
terminal. **The normal desktop workflow is Settings → Companion**, which
starts and stops this same sidecar as a child process and offers pairing and
revocation inline; the loopback page above is the same API rendered for
people not running the desktop app. Either way the sidecar only listens while
it is switched on, so the opt-in is never implicit.

| Environment | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `OMB_PORT` | `8799` | where the harness is |
| `OMB_WEBHOOK_PORT` | `OMB_PORT` + 1 | the harness's webhook receiver — refused, not used |
| `OMB_COMPANION_PORT` | `8810` | where devices connect |
| `OMB_CONTROL_PORT` | `8811` | the pairing page, loopback only |
| `OMB_COMPANION_DIR` | `~/.Roundtable-companion` | paired devices live here |
| `OMB_COMPANION_NAME` | your name, from the harness | what the phone calls this computer |

`OMB_COMPANION_NAME` overrides a name the sidecar otherwise asks the harness
for at startup — the profile from onboarding, as *"Ada's computer"*. It falls
back to `Roundtable` when the harness is not up or has no profile. Read once
and cached: the name goes into the Bonjour record, and re-advertising under a
new one later would show the phone two computers.

The harness owns two ports, not one: itself, and a webhook receiver one above
it (`OMB_WEBHOOK_PORT`). The companion refuses to start on either and says
which — the alternative is a race for the socket, where starting second means
the companion will not come up and starting first means webhooks quietly stop
working with the explanation logged somewhere else entirely.

## Layout

```text
src/index.ts    the entrypoint — three sockets, and the split between them
src/proxy.ts    the forwarding handler; also owns /api/pair
src/routes.ts   the allowlist — what a device may ask for
src/wire.ts     scrubbing, including the SSE stream transform
src/control.ts  the loopback pairing page
src/devices.ts  pairing codes and device tokens
src/listener.ts LAN and tailnet addresses
src/mdns.ts     the zero-dependency Bonjour responder
src/state.ts    where paired devices are written, atomically
test/           run against a real harness, booted per file
```

## Tests

`pnpm test` from the repo root covers this alongside everything else.

`test/proxy.test.ts` boots the real harness and drives the real proxy, because
every bug this design can have lives in the seam between them: an SSE event
that never terminates, a resume cursor dropped in transit, a `content-length`
set beside a `transfer-encoding`. None of those are visible to a unit test —
the last one was found by this suite within a minute of it existing.
