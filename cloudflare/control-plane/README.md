# Roundtable control plane

This directory is an isolated Cloudflare Worker for cloud account identity,
installation ownership, and per-installation managed companion endpoints. It
does **not** store or move local bots, chats, desktop SQLite state, prompts, or
tool output.

## What is included

- Better Auth 1.7.1 with email OTP, signed bearer sessions, hashed OTP storage,
  and D1-backed IP plus recipient rate limits.
- A Cloudflare Email Sending binding that produces both HTML and plain-text OTP
  messages. Authentication responses remain generic even when delivery fails;
  email addresses, OTPs, secrets, and provider errors are never logged.
- Owner-scoped desktop installations and independently revocable
  `omb_install_…` credentials. Account bearer tokens are never accepted as
  installation credentials, or vice versa.
- Exact-origin CORS, bounded JSON bodies, redacted errors, and `no-store` on
  every response.
- One remotely managed Cloudflare Tunnel per installation. Its opaque public
  hostname routes to the Electron-owned gateway at `http://127.0.0.1:8812`
  (never the reusable LAN listener on `8810`) and is followed by a mandatory
  `http_status:404` catch-all. A proxied CNAME points to
  `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com`.
- D1-backed generation/lease claims, recovery by stable opaque tunnel name, and
  retryable partial cleanup. Cloudflare API credentials and raw connector
  tokens are never written to D1 or logs.

The D1 schema is pinned in `migrations/`. `0001_better_auth_1_7_1.sql` was
generated from the exact Better Auth configuration. `0002_installations.sql`
contains only cloud ownership and credential metadata. `0003` adds a
recipient-scoped OTP limiter whose keys are HMACs rather than email addresses,
plus an authenticated installation-creation limiter. `0004` adds managed
endpoint resource IDs, lifecycle state, generation leases, redacted error
codes, and installation-scoped action limits. `0005` adds the cleanup-attempt
counter used for scheduled retry backoff. Endpoint rows deliberately do not
cascade away with a hard installation deletion: losing the tunnel and DNS IDs
would make operator cleanup impossible.

## API surface

| Method | Path | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | none |
| any | `/api/auth/*` | Better Auth |
| `GET` | `/v1/me` | account bearer |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/v1/installations` | account bearer |
| `POST` | `/v1/installations/:id/credentials/rotate` | owning account bearer |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/installations/:id` | owning account bearer |
| `GET` | `/v1/installations/self` | installation credential |
| `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` | `/v1/installations/self/endpoint` | installation credential |

Installation registration requires a stable `clientInstanceId`, a display
`name`, and a `platform` of `darwin`, `windows`, or `linux`; `appVersion` is
optional. A client ID is unique among one account's active installations. After
revocation, that account may register the stable ID again. Other accounts may
independently use the same client ID. An account may have at most 100 active
installations, matching the complete management-list limit. Creation is also
limited to 100 attempts per account per hour.

Raw installation credentials contain a random lookup ID plus 32 random bytes.
Only a SHA-256 digest is stored, and the raw value is returned only when an
installation is created or its credential is rotated. Credentials expire after
90 days even if they are not revoked; the response includes their expiry so a
signed-in desktop can rotate ahead of time. `/v1/installations/self` rejects
expired credentials and records both credential use and installation
`lastSeenAt`. Rotations are serialized with a one-minute cooldown, so concurrent
requests cannot both return credentials while one invalidates the other.

### Managed endpoint contract

All three endpoint methods require `Authorization: Bearer <omb_install_…>`.
Account bearer tokens are rejected.

- `GET` returns `{ "endpoint": null }` before allocation or after deletion.
  Otherwise it returns the HTTPS URL, hostname, lifecycle status, generation,
  timestamps, and a redacted `lastErrorCode`. It never returns a connector
  token.
- `POST` has no required body. It idempotently reserves or reconciles the
  endpoint, adopts a tunnel/DNS record created by an interrupted earlier run,
  and returns `{ endpoint, connectorToken }`. The raw token is obtained only
  after tunnel configuration and DNS are ready. The caller must place it
  directly in the operating system's secure credential store; it is not
  recoverable from GET or D1.
- `DELETE` removes DNS first and then the tunnel. It returns `204` when done or
  when already deleted. A partial Cloudflare failure returns
  `503 endpoint_cleanup_pending` and retains only the IDs needed for a retry.
  A concurrent mutation returns `409 endpoint_busy` with `Retry-After: 2`.

Hostnames have exactly one opaque label in front of the configured suffix:
`c-<32-lowercase-hex>.<COMPANION_HOST_SUFFIX>`. Set the suffix to a zone name
covered by the zone's edge certificate (normally the zone apex) so the endpoint
does not depend on deep-subdomain TLS coverage. Tunnel names are stable opaque
identifiers and contain no account email, display name, or client-supplied ID.

Endpoint provisioning is limited to 20 attempts per installation per hour;
deletion is limited to 30. A 60-second D1 lease and monotonically increasing
generation serialize concurrent requests. The owner renews and fences that
lease before every provider call, so an expired request cannot roll back a
resource adopted by its successor. Cloudflare calls have a five-second
per-request timeout, reject redirects, bound response bodies, and validate the
response shape before persisting an ID. Ambiguous create/update responses are
reconciled by the stable tunnel name and exact DNS identity. Before any
destructive cleanup, both stored IDs and provider-side names/targets are
revalidated; a renamed or repurposed resource is retained for an operator
instead of being guessed at. A newly created partial resource is rolled back;
an adopted resource is never deleted by a failed reconciliation.

Revoking an installation first revokes its local installation credentials, then
schedules best-effort endpoint cleanup. Cloud cleanup failure cannot restore or
delay credential revocation. Repeating the owner-scoped installation DELETE is
safe and retries retained cleanup state. A five-minute cron also processes at
most four expired-lease rows per run when they are already deleting, belong to
a revoked installation, or outlive a hard-deleted installation. The four-row
bound leaves the worst-case 40 external provider calls below the Workers Free
plan's 50-subrequest ceiling. Failed scheduled cleanups back off from five
minutes through 15 minutes, one hour, six hours, and then 24 hours. Once a
deletion has been pending for 24 hours, each eligible sweep emits a distinct
aggregate operator-attention log without installation or account identifiers.
This bounded sweep prevents a transient provider failure from orphaning
resources forever without creating an unbounded scheduled invocation.

## Local checks

Install from the repository root, then run:

```sh
pnpm control-plane:check
pnpm control-plane:test
pnpm control-plane:dry-run
```

For local manual development, copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars`, replace
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` with at least 32 cryptographically random bytes, provide a
non-production scoped `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, apply the migrations locally, and
start Wrangler:

```sh
pnpm --filter @Roundtable/control-plane exec wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local --config wrangler.jsonc
pnpm --filter @Roundtable/control-plane exec wrangler dev --config wrangler.jsonc
```

Do not commit `.dev.vars`.

## Production blockers

The checked-in Wrangler file is intentionally non-deployable production
scaffolding. No remote resource was created or changed while preparing it.
Before a production deployment, an operator must:

1. Choose and route an HTTPS hostname, then replace `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. The
   Worker has `workers_dev` disabled and no production route in this PR.
2. Generate a strong production `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and add it with Wrangler's
   interactive secret command. Add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` the same way. The
   checked-in `secrets.required` names validate local configuration and generate
   binding types; they do not contain or upload values.
3. Create the D1 database, replace the all-zero `database_id`, review the pinned
   migrations, and apply them to that database.
4. Complete Cloudflare Email Sending domain onboarding, replace the placeholder
   sender in both `EMAIL_FROM` and `allowed_sender_addresses`, and grant the
   deployment identity access to the binding. The Cloudflare session used while
   preparing this code could not list Email Sending (`2036 Unauthorized`), so no
   domain or binding activation was attempted.
5. Create a least-privilege Cloudflare API token scoped to the selected account
   and zone. It needs a Cloudflare Tunnel/`cloudflared` connector **Write**
   permission plus DNS **Read** and **Write** for that zone. Set
   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`, and add the token through
   `wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. Never put the token in `vars`,
   `.dev.vars.example`, logs, or CI output.
6. Set `COMPANION_HOST_SUFFIX` to the certificate-covered DNS suffix where
   opaque `c-*` records may be created. The configured zone must contain that
   suffix. This change does not create the zone, certificate, or any remote
   tunnel/DNS resources during build or tests.
7. Replace `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with a comma-separated allow-list of exact HTTPS
   application origins. Wildcards are deliberately unsupported.
8. Deploy the Worker and verify that `GET <BETTER_AUTH_URL>/healthz` returns
   exactly `{ "ok": true, "service": "Roundtable-control-plane" }` over
   HTTPS before shipping the desktop build. Electron probes this endpoint and
   keeps new hosted onboarding hidden until it is healthy; an already signed-in
   user remains visible so cleanup and recovery are not stranded.

The control-plane API token is never handed to a desktop. A desktop receives
only its tunnel connector token, which can run that one remotely managed tunnel.
The public companion service still enforces its own pairing and application
authentication; the tunnel is transport, not user authentication. This control
plane does not collect marketing consent.
