# Roundtable

**Your own team of AI bots, in a chat app.**

<sub>An open-source version of **Grok Bot** — bring-your-own-agent, local-first, on the models you already have.</sub>

Every bot in the sidebar is a real agent — Claude or Codex running locally under the hood — with its own
personality, its own model, its own cloud computer, and its own connected apps.
Talk to them like contacts. Watch them work. Approve what matters.

## Why

One assistant in one box is the wrong shape for agents. Roundtable is an open-source take on **Grok Bot** —
it keeps the idea (AI as a *messaging app*: a roster of bots you chat with, each with its own personality,
memory of its thread, model, computer, and apps) and rebuilds it open, local-first, and on the agents you
already have:

- **Bring your own agents.** Bots run on the `claude`, `codex`, and `grok` CLIs installed on your own machine
  — your existing logins and subscriptions, no new accounts, no proxy in the middle. Point any engine at a
  custom CLI binary (a versioned build or wrapper) in **Settings → Engines**.
- **Local first.** An Electron utility process owns every agent process and talks to the renderer over private,
  typed IPC. Transcripts, keys, and events live in `~/.Roundtable`, not a cloud or a loopback web service.
- **Agents with hands.** Each bot can use a cloud Linux desktop, an isolated Local VM, or—where the platform
  safety boundary is currently certified—your own computer, plus 500+ apps through Composio. Host control is
  available on macOS and Ubuntu Xorg after explicit opt-in. Ubuntu Wayland host control remains disabled while
  issue #345 is resolved.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Pick a brain per bot

A model picker with a provider rail — Claude and Codex models side by side, defaults marked, unavailable
providers dimmed with the reason. Switch a bot's model mid-conversation.

<img src="docs/screenshots/model-picker.png" alt="Model picker with provider rail" width="100%">

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🖥️ Every bot gets a computer

Open the Computer panel and the bot's cloud desktop spins up on its own — live screen preview while it
works, "Open desktop" to take over in your browser, or point the bot at *this Mac* instead.

<img src="docs/screenshots/computer-panel.png" alt="Computer panel with live screen preview" width="100%">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🙋 Bots ask before they act

Shell commands, file edits, and questions surface as inline cards — Allow / Deny / answer in chat. A
permission broker turns every risky action into a decision you make, for cloud and local computers alike.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔌 Connected apps

A one-click marketplace over Composio Sessions: Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Linear and hundreds more.
OAuth once, and every bot can use them as tools.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🗂 Manage bots like chats

Right-click any bot: pin, mark unread, edit profile, duplicate, copy conversation ID, hide, delete. It's a
messaging app — your agents behave like contacts.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔑 Keys once, everything lights up

Paste credentials in App Settings — they persist locally and the provider fleet hot-reloads instantly.
Secrets are write-only: the UI only ever sees "configured" flags.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### #️⃣ Channels for every context

Keep Work, Personal, and each project in separate channels without cloning your bots. Every channel has
its own transcript, shared instructions, working folder, responder rules, and editable bot roster. File a
channel and its bots under a named context, then rename it or change its members whenever the team changes.

### 📦 Install a complete team from one Markdown file

Browse outcome-driven teams on [BotMRR](https://botmrr.io), then choose **Add to Roundtable**. The app
opens a review screen before creating the bots, Chief of Staff, channels, playbooks, connector checklist,
and suggested routines. You can also import the same `.md` file from disk or paste its public GitHub URL
in **Teams → Import**.

The format stays portable: Roundtable reads the structured YAML frontmatter for a reliable one-click
install, while Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, and people can follow the ordinary Markdown playbook. Connections
remain off until you approve them, routines arrive paused, and packages never carry credentials,
conversations, permissions, memory, or computer access. Browse the
[open-source playbook repository](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-teams) or read its
[portable format](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-teams/blob/main/FORMAT.md).

### 🎧 Bots that talk back

Press the speaker on any reply, or switch a bot to read its answers out as they land — so you can listen
to what ran overnight while you make breakfast. Hit **call** and it's a conversation: it hears you, tells
you what it's doing while it works, and asks for approvals out loud.

Bring your own ElevenLabs key — paste it once in App Settings, pick a voice, and every bot can talk.
Give a bot its own voice and a channel stops sounding like one person.

**Also in the box:** streaming replies with tool-run activity chips · native macOS dictation from the
composer mic (on-device Apple speech recognition — desktop app) · SupaMaus cursor mascots with role-aware
expressions · screenshots of the bot's work folded into the transcript.

## How it works

Two processes. The sandboxed renderer sends typed commands through the preload bridge and folds one ordered IPC
event stream into state. The orchestration utility process owns every agent process and normalizes each provider's
native protocol into one canonical runtime event stream (logged per-thread as NDJSON).

| Layer | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Drivers | `server/drivers/` | One per provider: Claude, Codex, and Grok Build over their local CLIs (stream-JSON / JSON-RPC / ACP), plus a cloud-computer agent. Unknown drivers degrade to "unavailable", never crash the fleet. |
| Harness | `server/harness/` | Registry (configs → live instances) and the fan-in event bus every client folds. |
| Desktop IPC | `server/ipc-entry.ts`, `electron/preload.cjs` | Bots, turns, approvals, model catalog, computer lifecycle, connectors, and config without a listening TCP port. |
| Voice | `server/tts/` | ElevenLabs, bring your own key. Runs on the harness so the key never reaches the UI; markdown is rewritten into something worth hearing before it is spoken. |
| App | `src/` | The desktop chat shell. IPC-backed store, one reducer, and no direct Node access. |
| Desktop | `electron/` | macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu shell, typed preload boundary, embedded orchestrator, and platform capabilities. |

## Quick start

**Released builds:** the orchestration process is embedded; the app does not open a local HTTP port.

| | Download | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple silicon) | [Roundtable.dmg](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-releases/releases/latest/download/Roundtable.dmg) | Drag it to Applications, open it. Signed & notarized. |
| **macOS** (Intel) | [Roundtable-intel.dmg](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-releases/releases/latest/download/Roundtable-intel.dmg) | Same app, built for Intel Macs. Signed & notarized. |
| **Windows** (x64) | [Roundtable-setup.exe](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-releases/releases/latest/download/Roundtable-setup.exe) | Run it — one-click, per-user, no admin rights. The installer isn't code-signed yet, so SmartScreen shows "unknown publisher": **More info → Run anyway**. |
| **Ubuntu 24.04** (x64) | [Roundtable-amd64.deb](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-releases/releases/latest/download/Roundtable-amd64.deb) · [Roundtable.AppImage](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable-releases/releases/latest/download/Roundtable.AppImage) | Install the `.deb` with APT (recommended), or make the AppImage executable and run it. Beta; GNOME is the supported desktop. |

See the [Ubuntu Desktop guide](docs/linux-desktop.md) for installation, capabilities, and troubleshooting.

**From source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable && cd Roundtable
pnpm install

pnpm dev           # Vite renderer development server
pnpm dev:desktop   # build/start the IPC orchestrator and Electron shell
```

Requirements: **macOS, Windows, or Ubuntu 24.04 x64**, **Node 24+**, **pnpm**, and at least one agent CLI — [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code),
[`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [`grok`](https://x.ai/cli) — installed and logged in. They appear
in the model picker automatically.

Package the desktop application:

```sh
pnpm package:mac      # macOS: DMG + ZIP; requires Swift/Xcode tools
pnpm package:win      # Windows: installer + ZIP
pnpm package:linux    # Ubuntu x64: .deb + AppImage + verified CUA runtime
```

### Desktop capability status

| Capability | macOS | Ubuntu 24.04 Xorg | Ubuntu 24.04 Wayland |
|---|---|---|---|
| Packaged app, embedded harness, local agent CLIs | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Composio and Box/cloud computers | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Explicit preview-only local screen capture | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Bot control of this computer | Supported | Beta, explicit opt-in | Disabled: Wayland safety gate |
| Native on-device dictation | Supported | Planned | Planned |

The Linux preview is user-initiated and never enables local bot control or Auto routing. On Xorg, the reviewed Cua
Driver 0.19.3 runtime starts only after explicit opt-in and without its full-screen cursor overlay. On Wayland the
app never starts it and clears legacy opt-ins while that real-seat safety gate remains unresolved. Chat, preview,
Cloud, and Local VM remain available on both sessions. See the [Ubuntu Desktop guide](docs/linux-desktop.md) and tracking
issues [#29](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable/issues/29),
[#345](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable/issues/345), and
[#113](https://github.com/milind-soni/Roundtable/issues/113).

The Linux packager downloads only the tag-pinned upstream archive during the build, verifies its size, SHA-256,
complete member allowlist, and inner executable hashes, then packages only the CLI and cursor-theme sidecar. The
installed app never downloads or self-updates native automation code. Cua's MIT notice, Inter's SIL OFL, a generated
third-party license report, and a CycloneDX inventory ship with the runtime. See
[`third_party/cua-driver/`](third_party/cua-driver/) for the reviewed provenance record.

These credentials are optional — local chat works without them. Paste a key once in **App Settings** (gear
in the sidebar footer) when you want to enable its integration:

| Credential | What it enables | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| Composio project key (`ak_…`) | Connect Gmail, GitHub, Slack, Notion, and other apps to your bots | [Roundtable Composio setup](docs/composio.md) |
| Box API key | Give bots an isolated remote Linux computer with a desktop and terminal | [Box API key guide](https://docs.ascii.dev/box/api-keys) |
| ElevenLabs key | Read replies aloud, and call your bots | [ElevenLabs API keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) |

Composio and Box are third-party services with their own accounts and terms. Box is a paid service after
its trial, and using a cloud computer may incur charges.

```sh
pnpm typecheck     # app + server
pnpm test          # unit, driver, API, and desktop capability tests
pnpm build         # typecheck + production build
pnpm check:electron # syntax-check Electron main/preload files
pnpm package:win   # Windows installer + zip → release/
pnpm package:linux # Ubuntu x64 .deb + AppImage → release/
```

### Routines and webhook triggers

Routines can run once or on selected weekdays, using either a MAUS's configured model/computer or the
Cloud VM runner. Webhook triggers are independent from schedules but reuse the same queued task executor
and calendar receipts.

Roundtable starts a webhook-only receiver on `127.0.0.1:8800` by default (or one port above `OMB_PORT`).
Set `OMB_WEBHOOK_PORT` to choose another port. A webhook secret is shown once when the trigger is created
or rotated. Bearer authentication is recommended so the secret stays out of request URLs and most access
logs; a single capability URL remains available for senders that cannot configure headers. The receiver
exposes only `/health` and secret `/hooks/...` endpoints; it never exposes the app's broader API.
Roundtable must remain running to accept a delivery. For public internet delivery, proxy only this
dedicated receiver through a hosted relay or a tool such as Tailscale Funnel.

## Status

Early but real — the loop works end to end: message → agent → streamed reply → tools → approvals →
computer use. macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu 24.04 x64 have released builds; Ubuntu remains a beta with the
capability limits above. Rough edges to expect: hosted/mobile connectivity is still being built, and webhook
triggers currently use the local receiver rather than an always-on hosted relay.
Voice needs an ElevenLabs key, and calls are macOS-only for now (they ride the same on-device dictation as
the composer mic) — see [`docs/voice-mode.md`](docs/voice-mode.md) for the design and the known gaps.

Contributions welcome — the driver SPI in [`server/contracts.ts`](server/contracts.ts) is deliberately
small; adding a provider is one file in [`server/drivers/`](server/drivers/) plus a one-line registration.

## Support the project

Roundtable is free and open source. If it does real work for you, you can
[buy the project a coffee or become a monthly supporter](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_EEzWmormSVBD151HkmkyId9j0GPXina0KurfS1fYYcO) —
one-time any amount, or monthly. Payments are handled by [Polar](https://polar.sh/supamaus),
which takes care of receipts and taxes; nothing about the app ever sits behind a paywall.
