// The proxy-side half of computer control. The harness keeps the record of
// who is driving (server/computer-control.ts); the per-turn computer
// processes consult it through this client before acting, because the
// action paths themselves never traverse the harness — a box click goes
// straight to the box's REST API, while bridge-backed computers use a
// transparent stdio control channel.
//
// Failure posture: OPEN. Control is cooperation between the person and
// their own bot — "hold my hands while you're driving" — not a security
// boundary against a hostile agent (a hostile agent could reach the same
// REST endpoint without this proxy). Failing closed would mean a harness
// hiccup bricks every computer mid-turn, which costs more than the race
// it would prevent: while the person is driving they are watching the
// screen, and the panel shows the hold either way.
//
// The state is cached briefly so a computer_batch of two dozen actions
// doesn't turn into two dozen loopback round trips.
